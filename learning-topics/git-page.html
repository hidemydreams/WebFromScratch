                                        Git has exploded in popularity in recent years. The version control system is used by huge open source
                                         projects like Linux with thousands of contributors, teams of various sizes, solo developers and even students.

                                        Beginners are often terrified by all the cryptic commands and arguments that git requires. But you don't 
                                        need to know all of that to get started. You can begin by mastering a handful of the most often used ones, 
                                        and then slowly build from there. And this is exactly what we will teach you today. Let's begin!

                                        Git is a collection of command line utilities that track and record changes in files (most often source code, but you can track 
                                        anything you wish). With it you can restore old versions of your project, compare, analyze, merge changes and more. This process 
                                        is referred to as version control. There are a number of version control systems that do this job. You may have heard some of
                                         them - SVN, Mercurial, Perforce, CVS, Bitkeeper and more.<br>
                                        Git is decentralized, which means that it doesn't depend on a central server to keep old versions of your files. Instead it works
                                         fully locally by storing this data as a folder on your hard drive, which we call a repository. However you can store a copy of
                                          your repository online, which makes it easy for multiple people to collaborate and work on the same code. This is what websites 
                                          ike GitHub and BitBucket are used for.

                                        <b>1. Installing Git</b> <br>
                                        Installing Git on your machine is straightforward:<br>
                                
                                        <b>Linux</b> - Simply open up a new terminal and install git via your distribution's package manager. For Ubuntu the command is: 
                                        sudo apt-get install git<br>
                                        <b>Windows</b> we recommend git for windows as it offers both a GUI client and a BASH comand line emulator.
                                        <br>
                                        <b>OS X </b> - The easiest way is to install homebrew, and then just run brew install git from your terminal.
                                        <br> 
                                                                       
                                        If you are an absolute beginner, then a graphical git client is a must. We recommend GitHub Desktop and Sourcetree, but 
                                        there are many other good and free ones online. Getting to know the basic git commands is still important even if you use a GUI 
                                        app, so for the remaining of this lesson, this will be our only focus.<br>
                                    </p>

                                        <b>2. Configuring Git</b><br>
                                        Now that we've installed git on our computer, we will need to add some quick configurations. There are a lot of options that 
                                        can be fiddled with, but we are going to set up the most important ones: our username and email. Open a terminal and run these 
                                        commands:<br>
                                
                                        $ git config --global user.name "My Name"<br>
                                        $ git config --global user.email myEmail@example.com<br>
                                        Every action we do in Git will now have a stamp with our name and address on it. This way users always know who did what and 
                                        everything is way more organized.
                                        <br>

                                        <b>3. Creating a new repository - git init</b><br>
                                        As we mentioned earlier, git stores its files and history directly as a folder in your project. To set up a new repository,
                                         we need to open a terminal, navigate to our project directory and run git init. This will enable Git for this particular folder
                                         and create a hidden .git directory where the repository history and configuration will be stored.
                                        <br>
                                        Create a folder on your Desktop called git_exercise, open a new terminal and enter the following:
                                        <br>
                                        $ cd Desktop/git_exercise/<br>
                                        $ git init<br>
                                        The command line should respond with something along the lines of:<br>
                                     
                                        Initialized empty Git repository in /home/user/Desktop/git_exercise/.git/<br>
                                        This means that our repo has been successfully created but is still empty. Now create a simple text file called hello.txt and 
                                        save it in the git_exercise folder.
                                        <br>
                                    </p>   
                                    <p class="desc article__text"> 
                                        <b>4. Checking the status - git status</b><br>
                                        Git status is another must-know command that returns information about the current state of the repository: is everything up 
                                        to date, what's new, what's changed, and so on. Running git status in our newly created repo should return the following:
                                        <br>
                                        $ git status<br>
                                
                                        On branch master<br>
                                
                                        Initial commit<br>
                                
                                        Untracked files:<br>
                                        (use "git add ..." to include in what will be committed)<br>
                                
                                            hello.txt<br>
                                        The returned message states that hello.txt is untracked. This means that the file is new and Git doesn't know yet if it should
                                         keep track of the changes happening to that file or just ignore it. To acknowledge the new file, we need to stage it.

                                        Git has the concept of a "staging area". You can think of this like a blank canvas, which holds the changes which you would like
                                         to commit. It starts out empty, but you can add files to it (or even single lines and parts of files) with the git add command, 
                                         and finally commit everything (create a snapshot) with git commit.
                                        <br>
                                        In our case we have only one file so let's add that:<br>
                                
                                        $ git add hello.txt<br>
                                        If we want to add everything in the directory, we can use:<br>
                                
                                        $ git add -A<br>
                                        Checking the status again should return a different response from before.<br>
                                        
                                        $ git status<br>

                                        Changes to be committed:<br>
                                        (use "git rm --cached ..." to unstage)<br>
                                
                                            new file:   hello.txt<br>
                                        Our file is ready to be commited. The status message also tells us what has changed about the files in the staging area -
                                         in this case its new file, but it can be modified or deleted, depending on what has happened to a file since the last git add.

                                        A commit represents the state of our repository at a given point in time. It's like a snapshot, which we can go back to and 
                                        see how thing were when we took it.
                                        <br>
                                        To create a new commit we need to have at least one change added to the staging area (we just did that with git add) and run the 
                                        following:
                                        <br>
                                        $ git commit -m "Initial commit."<br>
                                        This will create a new commit with all the changes from the staging area (adding hello.txt). The -m "Initial commmit" part is 
                                        a custom user-written description that summarizes the changes done in that commit. It is considered a good practice to commit 
                                        often and always write meaningful commit messages.

                                        In order to upload something to a remote repo, we first have to establish a connection with it. For the sake of this tutorial 
                                        our repository's address will be https://github.com/tutorialzine/awesome-project. We advise you to go ahead and create your own 
                                        empty repository at GitHub, BitBucket or any other service. The registration and setup may take a while, but all services offer
                                        good step-by-step guides to help you.<br>
                                        
                                        To link our local repository with the one on GitHub, we execute the following line in the terminal:<br>
                                        
                                        # This is only an example. Replace the URI with your own repository address.
                                        $ git remote add origin https://github.com/tutorialzine/awesome-project.git
                                        A project may have many remote repositories at the same time. To be able to tell them apart we give them different names. 
                                        Traditionally the main remote repository in git is called origin.

                                        Now it's time to transfer our local commits to the server. This process is called a push, and is done every time we want to update

                                        The Git command to do this is git push and takes two parameters - the name of the remote repo (we called ours origin) and the 
                                        branch to push to (master is the default branch for every repo).<br>

                                        When developing a new feature, it is considered a good practice to work on a copy of the original project, called a branch. 
                                        Branches have their own history and isolate their changes from one another, until you decide to merge them back together.

                                        Many features can be safely developed at once by different people.<br>
                                        Developers can work on their own branch, without the risk of their codebase changing due to someone else's work.<br>
                                        When unsure what's best, multiple versions of the same feature can be developed on separate branches and then compared.<br>

                                         to switch to the other branch. This is done with the git checkout command, expecting one parameter - the branch to switch to.<br>

                                        Every commit has it's unique id in the form of a string of numbers and symbols. To see a list of all commits and their ids we 
                                        can use git log:

                                        We've compared the first commit to the last one, so we see all the changes that have ever been made. Usually it's easier
                                         to do this using the git difftool command which brings up a graphical client showing all differences side-to-side.

                                        Git allows us to return any selected file back to the way it was in a certain commit. This is done via the familiar git 
                                        checkout command, which we used earlier to switch branches, but can also be used to swtich between commits (it's pretty 
                                        common in Git for one command to be used for multiple seemingly unrelated tasks).<br>
                                        
                                        In the following example we will take hello.txt and reverse everything we've done to it since the initial commit. 
                                        To do so we have to supply the id of the commit we want to go back to, as well as the full path to our file.<br>
                                        
                                        $ git checkout 09bd8cc1 hello.txt
                                    </p>

                                          <b> 3. Fixing a commit</b> <br>
                                        If you notice that you've made a typo in your commit message, or you've forgotten to add a file and you see right 
                                        after you commit, you can easily fix this with git commit --amend. This will add everything from the last commit back 
                                        to the staging area, and attempt to make a new commit. This gives you a chance to fix your commit message or add more files
                                        to the staging area.<br>
                                        
                                        For more complex fixes that aren't in the last commit (or if you've pushed your changes already), you've got to use git revert. 
                                        This will take all the changes that a commit has introduced, reverse them, and create a new commit that is the exact opposite.<br>
                                        
                                        The newest commit can be accessed by the HEAD alias.<br>
                                        
                                        $ git revert HEAD<br>
                                        For other commits it's best to use an id.<br>
                                        
                                        $ git revert b10cc123<br>
                                        When reverting older commits, keep in mind that merge conflicts are very likely to appear. This happens when a file has been
                                         altered by another more recent commit, and now Git cannot find the right lines to revert, since they aren't there anymore.<br>

                                        <b>4. Resolving Merge Conflicts</b>
                                        Apart from the scenario depicted in the previous point, conflicts regularly appear when merging branches or pulling someone 
                                        else's work. Sometimes conflicts are handled automatically by git, but other times the person dealing with them has to decide
                                         (and usually handpick) what code stays and what is removed.<br>
                                        
                                        Let's look at an example where we're trying to merge two branches called john_branch and tim_branch. Both John and Tim are writing
                                         in the same file a function that displays all the elements in an array.<br>
                                        
                                        John is using a for loop:<br>
                                        // Use a for loop to console.log contents.<br>
                                        for(var i=0; i<arr.length; i++) {<br>
                                            console.log(arr[i]);<br>
                                        }
                                        Tim prefers forEach:<br>
                                        
                                        // Use forEach to console.log contents.<br>
                                        arr.forEach(function(item) {<br>
                                            console.log(item);<br>
                                        });<br>
                                        They both commit their code on their respective branch. Now if they try to merge the two branches they will see the 
                                        following error message:<br>
                                        
                                        $ git merge tim_branch <br>

                                        Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.<br>
                                        Git wasn't able to merge the branches automatically, so now it's up to the devs to manually resolve the conflict. 
                                        If they open the file where the conflict resides, they'll see that Git has inserted a marker on the conflicting lines.<br>

                                        // Use forEach to console.log contents.<br>
                                        arr.forEach(function(item) {<br>
                                            console.log(item);<br>

                                        Above the ===== we have the current HEAD commit, and below the conflicting one. This way we can clearly see the differences, 
                                        and decide which is the better version, or write a new one all together. In this situation we go for the latter and rewrite 
                                        the whole thing, removing the markers to let Git know we're done.<br>
                                        
                                        // Not using for loop or forEach.<br>
                                        // Use Array.toString() to console.log contents.<br>
                                        console.log(arr.toString());<br>
                                        When everything is set, a merge commit has to be done to finish the process.<br>
                                        
                                        $ git add -A<br>
                                        $ git commit -m "Array printing conflict resolved."<br>
                                        As you can see this process is quite tiresome and can get extremely hard to deal with in large projects. Most developers
                                         prefer to resolve conflicts with the help of a GUI client, which makes things much easier. To run a graphical client use git
                                          mergetool.<br>

                                        <b>5. Setting up .gitignore</b>
                                        In most projects there are files or entire folders that we don't want to ever commit. We can make sure that they aren't 
                                        accidentally included in our git add -A by creating a .gitignore file:</b>
                                        
                                        Manually create a text file called .gitignore and save it in your project's directory.</b>
                                        Inside, list the names of files/directories to be ignored, each on a new line.</b>
                                        The .gitignore itself has to be added, committed and pushed, as it is just like any other file in the project.</b>
                                        Good examples for files to be ignored are:</b>
                                        
                                        log files</b>
                                        task runner builds</b>
                                        the node_modules folder in node.js projects</b>
                                        folders created by IDEs like Netbeans and IntelliJ</b>
                                        personal developer notes</b>
                                        A .gitignore banning all of the above will look like this:</b>
                                        
                                        *.log</b>
                                        build/</b>
                                        node_modules/</b>
                                        .idea/</b>
                                        my_notes.txt</b>
                                        The slash at the end of some of the lines signals that this is a folder and we are ignoring everything inside it recursively.
                                        The asterisk serves it's usual function as a wild card.<br></b><br>
